Introduction

RRGP is a network protocol for playing the ricochet robots game.  It permits
a single server to host multiple games with named participants.  The
protocol is designed so that people can play using only telnet, but it is
expected that graphical interfaces will be able to drive the protocol as
well.

RRGP borrows ideas from other network protocols like SMTP using a
synchronous command interface.

Document Conventions

	All commands include a response (yeah, synchronous protocols are
	bad.  tough)

	<command> <args> 

	->

	<success-code>
	<response> <data>

	<success-code> is one of:

	OK
	ERROR <message>

	If <success-code> is "OK", then the reply data will follow and be
	terminated by "DONE"

1. Requests

1.1 Connection setup

	The RRGP server has no well defined port; agreement on which port to
	use must be done through some external mechanism.  Once connected,
	the client must identify itself:
	
	HELO <username>
	
	->
	
	OK
	WELCOME <servername>
	DONE

1.2. Listing available users

	WHO

	->

	OK
	USER <username1>
	USER <username2>
	...
	DONE

1.3. Listing available games

	GAMES

	->

	OK
	BOARD <board1>
	BOARD <board2>
	...
	DONE

1.4. Listing users in a game

	USERS <board>

	->

	OK
	USER <username1>
	USER <username2>
	...
	DONE

1.5. Creating a new game

	NEW

	->

	OK
	BOARD <board>
	DONE

1.6. Joining an existing game

	JOIN <board>

	->

	OK
	USER <username1>
	USER <username2>
	...
	DONE

	Possible errors: NOGAME

1.7. Watching an existing game

	WATCH <board>

	->

	OK
	USER <username1>
	USER <username2>
	...
	DONE

	The client will monitor the game, but not be listed in the
	userlist nor be allowed to make moves.

	Possible errors: NOGAME

1.8. Get the board contents

	SHOW

	->

	OK
	SPC <spc-data>
	ROW <row-data>
	...
	DONE

	"<spc-data>" is either '   ', ' | ' or '---'.  "<row-data>" is
	either ' . ', ' | ', ' <color><shape>', '_<color><shape>',
	' ww', '_ww', ' <color> ' or '_<color>_'.
	
	<color> is 'R', 'Y', 'G' or 'B', shape is 't', 's', 'o', 'c'

	Possible errors: NOGAME

1.9. Bid

	BID <number>

	->

	OK
	DONE

	Possible errors: TIMEOUT

1.10. Move

	MOVE <color>, <dir>

	->

	OK
	DONE

	<color> is one of 'R', 'Y', 'G' or 'B', <dir> is one of 'N', 'E',
	'S' or 'W'.


1.11. Reset

	RESET

	->

	OK
	DONE

1.12. Next turn

	TURN

	->

	OK
	DONE

2. Asynchronous notification.  

	The server will send notices to each user in a game whenever
        there is a move. It will also send notices to every connected
        client when additional people join or new games are
        started. These are of the form:

	NOTICE
	<notice-code> <args>
	DONE

2.1. Move notice

	NOTICE
	MOVE <color>, <dir>
	DONE

2.2. New users

	NOTICE
	USER <username>
	DONE

2.3. Disconnected user

	NOTICE
	PART <username>
	DONE

2.4. New games

	NOTICE
	BOARD <board>
	DONE

2.5. Terminated games

	NOTICE
	TERMINATE <board>
	DONE

2.6. Bids

	NOTICE
	BID <number>, <username>
	DONE

2.7. Timer

	NOTICE
	TIME <seconds>
	DONE

	Timer ticks are sent every 10 seconds

2.8. Next turn

	NOTICE
	TURN <color><shape>
	DONE

	<color><shape> will be 'ww' for the whirlpool.

3. Errors

	The following error codes may be returned.

3.1. No such game

	ERROR NOGAME

	A game number was requested but no such game exists.

	Possibly returned by: JOIN, WATCH

3.2. Time out

	ERROR TIMEOUT

	A bid was submitted after the timer expired.

	Possibly returned by: BID

Some comments from Carl Worth
-----------------------------
I don't understand the board contents. What is '_'?  How are robot and
target colors indicated for the same space?

Can we replace "BOARD" with "GAME" in the protocol?

Shall we require a quorum for TURN? Perhaps no quorum requirement
after the timer has run out and a correct solution has been
demonstrated?

What are the semantics of RESET? Quorum?

Hmmm... looks like a user can only be in a single game (would need to
fix SHOW, BID, MOVE, RESET, TURN, NOTICE, etc.)

I wonder if this server should just support one game at a time,
(available servers/users for other games can be negotiated
externally).

And does the server know the rules/keep score?

Do we allow broadcast and private messages?
