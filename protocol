Introduction

RRGP is a network protocol for playing the ricochet robots game.  It permits
a single server to host multiple games with named participants.  The
protocol is designed so that people can play using only telnet, but it is
expected that graphical interfaces will be able to drive the protocol as
well.

RRGP borrows ideas from other network protocols like SMTP using a
synchronous command interface.

Document Conventions

	All commands include a response (yeah, synchronous protocols are
	bad.  tough)

	<command> <args> 

	->

	<response>

	<response> is one of:

	<command> <args>
	ERROR <message>

1. Requests

1.1 Connection setup

	The RRGP server has no well defined port; agreement on which port to
	use must be done through some external mechanism.  Once connected,
	the client must identify itself:
	
	HELO <username>
	
	->
	
	HELO <servername>

1.2. Listing available users

	WHO

	->

	WHO <username1> <games1> <username2> <games2> ...

	lists connected users and the number of games they've won.

1.3. Listing available games

	GAMES

	->

	GAMES <game1> <game2> ...

1.4. Listing players in a game

	PLAYERS <game>

	->

	PLAYERS <username1> <score1> <username2> <score2> ...

1.5. Listing watchers of a game

	WATCHERS <game>

	->

	WATCERS <username1> <username2> ...

1.5. Get game information

	GAMEINFO <game>

	->

	GAMEINFO <turn> <color> <shape> <state> <time> <bid> <active>

	<turn> is a number from 1 to 17 indicating the current turn
	<color> <shape> indicate the active piece
	<state> is one of:
		new	Turn just started, no bids yet
		bid	Bidding opened.  <time> indicates time remaining,
			<bid> indicates the minimum bid
		show	Bidding closed and solution being demonstrated
			<active> indicates the person demonstrating
		solved 	Solution succesfully demonstrated that
			is less than the active users bid. <active>
			indicates the winner.
	<time> is valid only in BID state, else it's 0
	<bid> is valid in all but NEW state where it's 0
	<active> is valid in SHOW and SOLVED states, else it's ""

1.6. Get user information

	USERINFO <username>

	->

	USERINFO <game> <playing> <score> <bid>

	<game> is any currently associated game, else "".  If the user
	is not associated with any game, the remaining fields are
	false 0 0.
	
	<playing> is true if the user is playing and false if watching.

	<score> is a number from 0 to 17 indicating this players score

	<bid> is either "0" indicating no bid or a number indicating
	the users minimum bid.
	
1.7. Creating a new game

	NEW <game-suggestion>

	->

	NEW <game>

1.8. Joining an existing game

	JOIN <game>

	->

	JOIN

	Possible errors: NOGAME

1.9. Watching an existing game

	WATCH <game>

	->

	WATCH

	The client will monitor the game, but not be listed in the
	userlist nor be allowed to make moves.

	Possible errors: NOGAME

1.10. Dispose an empty game

	DISPOSE <game>

	->

	DISPOSE

	Disposes <game> unless it still has players associated.

	Possible errors: NOGAME NOTEMPTY

1.10. Get the game contents

	SHOW

	->

	SHOW <game-board>

	<game-board> is a quoted multi-line string containing an
	diagram of the game contents, (an array of cells). A single
	cell and its surrounding are indicated as:

	 HHH 
	VrcsV
	 HHH

	H = ' ' or '='
	V = ' ' or '|'
	r = '.' or <robot-color>  (one of 'r', 'g', 'b', or 'y')
	c = '.' or <target-color> (one of 'r', 'g', 'b', or 'y')
	s = '.' or <target-shape> (one of 'c', 's', 'o', or 't')

	The goal robot and target (color and shape) are indicated with
	capital letters.

	For example:

	SHOW "
	 ===
	|R.. ... .gs
	
	 byc|... .RT|
	 ===    ==="

	R.. = 	Red robot (goal robot)
	.gs = 	Green square target
	byc = 	Blue robot on yellow circle target

	MOVE <color> <dir1> <dir2> ...

	->

	MOVE <count>

	<color> is one of 'R', 'Y', 'G' or 'B', <dir> is one of 'N', 'E',
	'S' or 'W'.

	Possible errors: NOTINGAME, NOTACTIVE, BLOCKED, TOOMANYMOVES

1.14. Undo

	help on a specific command, otherwise displays an overview of
	all commands.

2. Asynchronous notification.  

	The server will send notices to each user in a game whenever
        there is a move. It will also send notices to every connected
        client when additional people join or new games are
        started. These are of the form:

	NOTICE <notice-code> <args>

	Game-specific notices are sent to users involved in the related
	game, other notices are sent to all users.  Note that even the user
	originating the notice receives a copy.

2.1. Move notice (game)

	NOTICE MOVE <count> <color> <dir>

Some comments/questions
-----------------------

>> Hmmm... looks like a user can only be in a single game (would need to
>> fix SHOW, BID, MOVE, RESET, TURN, NOTICE, etc.)

> Yup.

It doesn't seem right to support multiple games in a single server yet
not allow the same user to JOIN or WATCH more than one game
simultaneously.

Or is the idea that I connect as cworth1, cworth2, etc.? (ugh)

--

The server manages ACTIVE based on bids, scores, and PASS
requests. Once a turn is over, (solution demonstrated or all bidding
users PASS), it would be nice to allow others to show alternate
solutions, failed attempts, etc. Shall we provide a way for the ACTIVE
user to pass control to another, (only when a turn is over)? Or maybe
since the turn is over we just let any user move the pieces?

--

We should add PART and UNWATCH commands to leave the current game,
(while still staying connected to perhaps join other games).
