Introduction

RRGP is a network protocol for playing the Ricochet Robots game.  It permits
a single server to host multiple games with named participants.  The
protocol is designed so that people can play using only telnet, but it is
expected that graphical interfaces will be able to drive the protocol as
well.

RRGP borrows ideas from other network protocols like SMTP using a
synchronous command interface.

Document Conventions

	All commands include a response (yeah, synchronous protocols are
	bad.  tough)

	<command> <args> 

	->

	<response>

	<response> is one of:

	<command> <args>
	ERROR <message>

1. Requests

1.1 Connection setup

    The RRGP server has no well defined port; agreement on which port to
    use must be done through some external mechanism.  Once connected,
    the client must identify itself:
    
    HELO <username>
    
    ->
    
    HELO <servername>

1.2. Global commands

	GAMES

	->

2. Asynchronous notification.  

    The server will send notices to each user in a game whenever
    there is a move. It will also send notices to every connected
    client when additional people join or new games are
    started. These are of the form:

	NOTICE <notice-code> <args>

    Game-specific notices are sent to users involved in the related
    game, other notices are sent to all users.  Note that even the user
    originating the notice receives a copy.

Some comments/questions
-----------------------

The server manages ACTIVE based on bids, scores, and PASS
requests. Once a turn is over, (solution demonstrated or all bidding
users PASS), it would be nice to allow others to show alternate
solutions, failed attempts, etc. Shall we provide a way for the ACTIVE
user to pass control to another, (only when a turn is over)? Or maybe
since the turn is over we just let any user move the pieces?
